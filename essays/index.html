                        Google is slowing down battery life on older Pixel models-specifically the Google Pixel 4a-following its new 
                        <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/good-news-bad-news-pixel-4a-is-getting-an-update-but-it-reduces-battery-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security update</a>.
                        The Pixel 4a hadn't received an update since August 2023, but out of the blue, an "essential" update from Google has stunned many users.
                        <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15701861" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google claims</a> this update is for improving battery stability, but it feels like another case of planned obsolescence.

                        Planned obsolescence is just a fancy way of saying, "Let's haul more profits out of our new products by pushing consumers to upgrade."
                        Technologies developed this way gradually force users to upgrade every few years. One notorious tactic is monopolizing replacement parts by serializing components and keeping schematics behind closed doors-giving companies control over the repair market.
                        These practices go against consumer rights and violate the ethos of free market capitalism. The goal is to drive hype for new gadgets, which are often only marginally improved from previous models.

                    <p>
                        When you can't repair a 4-5 year old device because a $20 component is sold for $200, or using a third-party part disables features because "it's not OEM approved," you know modern gadgets are being made disposable. The resulting e-waste from such practices is staggering.

                        After the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54996601" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Batterygate</a> scandal from Apple, it's reasonable to view Google's statement with skepticism. At least Google is being upfront about its motives-perhaps something learned from Apple's class action lawsuit. Offering free replacement batteries for affected devices is a smart move, but the $100 store credit for a Pixel upgrade says it all. You see where this is going.
