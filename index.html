                Hey! Greetings and Salutaions, this is Upen or TheNerdyEngineer
                if you've come across any of my digital footprint. I'm fascinated by
                technology and aviation so, I mostly write in these domains. The technological
                history encapsulates the humankind from discovery of fire to silicon breakthrough, 
                so it's really important to appreciate all the sacrifices made along the way.
                There were/are countless individuals who've contributed to the technological leap
                some-of-whom were deemed heros while some dissapeared to obscurity. 
                My head bows to all those who were there and made it possible! 
                
                </p>
