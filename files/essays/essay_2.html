                Google is slowing down older Pixel model - Google Pixel 4a, following its new <div class="inner-link"><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/good-news-bad-news-pixel-4a-is-getting-an-update-but-it-reduces-battery-life/)">security update</a></div>. 
                Pixel 4a hasn't received another update since its last one in August 2023 but out-of-blue an essential update from Google on Pixel 4a has stunned many users. <div class="inner-link"><a href=""https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15701861>Google cites</a></div> this update is essential for improving battery stability but I believe
                it's one of the planned obsolescence act.   
                </p>
                <h1>Why planned Obsolescence is not a good idea?</h1>
                <p>Planned Obsolescence is just a fancy nomenclature for <em>"Let's haul more profits out of our new products by forcing out to consumers."</em> The technologies being developed
                this way slowly shifts the consumer paradigm, passively forcing them for upgrade every 2-3 years. One of the notorious tactics is by monopolizing replacement parts by serializing
                components, and keeping schematics behind closed doors -it allows control over the repair market. These kind of activities goes against consumer rights and vioaltes the ethoes laid by free market capitalism.
                The goal from planned obsolescence is to drive the market go crazy about upcoming new gadgets - which mostly will be only marginally improved version from the preceding model.
                When one cannot repair their 4-5 year old device because a $20 component is charged ridiculously at $200, and use of similar quality component from third party vendors 
                disables some features  because "Oh! I'm sorry, but this is not OEM approved", that's when you know modern gadgets are garbage. Imagine the extent of e-waste from such practice.
                </br></br>
                Following previous <div class="inner-link"><a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15701861">Batterygate</a></div> scandal from Apple, there's valid reason to view Google's statement with skepticism. 
                The only good side of this is, at least Google is forthcoming with their motives - maybe something they learnt from class action lawsuit against Apple. Google offering free-
                replacement battery for impacted devices however is a smart move. What caught my eye was $100 store credit for upgrade on pixel device, Exactly!!! You see where this is going.
