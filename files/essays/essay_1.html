                <p>
                    Since the start of the second decade of 21<sup>st</sup> century, 
                    academic value associated with institute for higher studies has been 
                    caught massive off guard. The revelations from the Singer Scandal 
                    has exhibited innate societal status imprinted with attending Elite 
                    institutions, and they want it kept that way. In the light of aftermath
                    it really begs the question, "Has the intrinstic value of learning 
                    and cause a University stands for, been overruled by extreme capitalism?".
                    </br></br>
                    It's not uncommon for someone in persuit of good academic background 
                    be caught in the paranoia of getting into a good college. But every
                    individual has his/her own stance on what the "good" entails. That's 
                    where the ranking comes in, many of us student alike associate quantified 
                    University standing to be a measure for high academic and professional 
                    success. I believe the situation is exacerbated by growing outreach of 
                    social sites with the connectivity it holds. Most of us students are 
                    inspired by individuals who've broke the orthodox aura surrounding the 
                    society, becoming first batch of change-makers who've restructured our 
                    existing understanding or redesigned a certain or multiple industry. 
                    So it's not crazy to aim for institutions where they once used to 
                    frequent. But in trying to follow their footsteps we inadvertently 
                    try mimiking their movements. We hallucinate ourself by wrongly 
                    correlating success to a particular institution. Alongside this, we 
                    mostly leave luck and luxury out of the equation. It's not to say that
                    the institution had no impact on their personal and professional upbringing. 
                    Almost all of those individuals were attracted by institutions that 
                    aligned with their values and purpose or wanted to work with certain 
                    Professors whose work they'd closely followed. When alike minds 
                    congregate, they often attract minds with similar goals. Hence,
                    the institution becomes a intellectual and innovation powerhouse. 
                    The institution that serves and facilitates such activities without 
                    strings attached prospers while many entangled in politics haywires. 
                    </br></br>
                    But the situtation seems to be changing now, sporadic news regarding
                    improper admissions conduct, academic dishonesty, data fraud escapes
                    out, often leading to moral questions. It really makes one ponder when
                    we hear wealthy people bribing their children's way into instituions while
                    those children could have all the resources and luxury to legitimately 
                    pave their way. Eventually, it all boils down to status - a socio-stratification 
                    created that values perception of intelligence more than wisdowm.
